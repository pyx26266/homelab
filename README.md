# Home datacenter
Contemprory to its name it is just a small server based on commodity hardware.
To justify the data-center name we gonna witness Identity and Access Management as well. \
It has a scope to serve the whole family member independently and offsite backup support as well.

# Guiding principles
1. Focus should be on software env. Hardware & Data is the commodity and services/applications are the uniqueness.
2. Security and Privacy are primary concerns. For the starter we gonna disconnect the server from internet. Even in future it will be window based access not continuous.
3. CapEx and OpEx should be minimal
4. mainly for people who are busy and can deliver 1-2 hrs/week.
